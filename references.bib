  abstract = {{The third edition of this highly successful textbook has been carefully revised and updated, and includes a new chapter on infinite graphs. The book covers all major, recent developments, and can be used both as a reliable textbook for an introductory course and as a graduate text: on each topic it covers all the basic material in full detail, and adds one or two deeper results (again with detailed proofs) to illustrate the more advanced methods of that field. From the reviews of the first two editions (1997, 2000): "This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory." Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum "The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory." Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications "A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors."

 abstract = {<p>This is the classic work upon which modern-day game theory is based. What began more than sixty years ago as a modest proposal that a mathematician and an economist write a short paper together blossomed, in 1944, when Princeton University Press published<em>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior</em>. In it, John von Neumann and Oskar Morgenstern conceived a groundbreaking mathematical theory of economic and social organization, based on a theory of games of strategy. Not only would this revolutionize economics, but the entirely new field of scientific inquiry it yielded--game theory--has since been widely used to analyze a host of real-world phenomena from arms races to optimal policy choices of presidential candidates, from vaccination policy to major league baseball salary negotiations. And it is today established throughout both the social sciences and a wide range of other sciences.</p><p>This sixtieth anniversary edition includes not only the original text but also an introduction by Harold Kuhn, an afterword by Ariel Rubinstein, and reviews and articles on the book that appeared at the time of its original publication in the<em>New York Times</em>, tthe<em>American Economic Review</em>, and a variety of other publications. Together, these writings provide readers a matchless opportunity to more fully appreciate a work whose influence will yet resound for generations to come.</p>},

ABSTRACT = {We introduce and explore a family of vertex-coloring problems, which, surprisingly enough, have not been considered before despite stemming from the problem of Wi-Fi channel assignment. Given a spectrum of colors, endowed with a matrix of interferences between each pair of colors, the Threshold Spectrum Coloring problem fixes the number of colors available and aims to minimize the interference threshold, i.e., the maximum of the interferences at the vertices. Conversely, the Chromatic Spectrum Coloring problem fixes a threshold and aims to minimize the number of colors for which respecting that threshold is possible. As the main theoretical results, we prove tight upper bounds for the solutions to each problem. Since both problems turn out to be NP-hard, we complete the scene with experimental results. We propose a DSATUR-based heuristic and study its performance to minimize the maximum vertex interference in Wi-Fi channel assignment, both for randomly-generated graphs and for a real-world scenario. Further, for all these graphs, we experimentally check the goodness of the theoretical bounds.},
