@book{citeulike:395714,
  abstract = {{The third edition of this highly successful textbook has been carefully revised and updated, and includes a new chapter on infinite graphs. The book covers all major, recent developments, and can be used both as a reliable textbook for an introductory course and as a graduate text: on each topic it covers all the basic material in full detail, and adds one or two deeper results (again with detailed proofs) to illustrate the more advanced methods of that field. From the reviews of the first two editions (1997, 2000): "This outstanding book cannot be substituted with any other book on the present textbook market. It has every chance of becoming the standard textbook for graph theory." Acta Scientiarum Mathematicarum "The book has received a very enthusiastic reception, which it amply deserves. A masterly elucidation of modern graph theory." Bulletin of the Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications "A highlight of the book is what is by far the best account in print of the Seymour-Robertson theory of graph minors."  Mathematika ". . . like listening to someone explain mathematics." Bulletin of the AMS}},
